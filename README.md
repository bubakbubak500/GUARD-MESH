- Initial upstream baseline: `main` at `6fe6b9f06332708b6ed0cc78958017d0dcc9e35d`
  (`beta_83`), imported on 2026-09-19 with its Git history.
- License: **GPL-3.0-or-later**. Original copyright notices and third-party
  licenses are preserved in [LICENSE](LICENSE), [NOTICE](NOTICE), and the sources.
- Development is directed by Guardian's needs. Contributions are by invitation;
  see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the single-owner review policy.
- The upstream firmware and build instructions below are retained as the starting
  point. Guardian-specific firmware changes have not yet been applied.

<p align="center"><b>A real touchscreen UI for your mesh radio.</b> &middot; open source &middot; GPL-3.0</p>

Touch-UI [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) companion-radio
firmware for the **LilyGo T-Deck / T-Deck Plus**, **Heltec V4 + TFT** and eight other boards
(ESP32-S3).

An LVGL touch UI — map, chat, contacts, channels, settings — split out of
[meshcomod](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/meshcomod). The app depends on a
MeshCore fork via PlatformIO `lib_deps`.

## Boards

See **[DEVICES.md](DEVICES.md)** for the full support matrix, install paths and
per-board status.

- LilyGo T-Deck / T-Deck Plus — env `LilyGo_TDeck_companion_radio_touch` (stable)
- Heltec V4 + TFT + CHSC6x touch — env `heltec_v4_tft_companion_radio_usb_tcp_touch` (stable)
- Tanmatsu (ESP32-P4) — built from `tanmatsu/` (ESP-IDF), ships via the Tanmatsu app store — [sideload guide](TANMATSU_SIDELOAD.md) for running your own build
- Elecrow ThinkNode M9 — env `ThinkNode_M9_companion_radio_touch` (beta) — [keyboard & d-pad guide](THINKNODE_M9_SHORTCUTS.md)
- RAK WisMesh Tap V2 (RAK3312) — env `rak_tap_v2_companion_radio_touch` (beta)
- LilyGo T-Lora Pager — envs `tlora_pager_lr1121_companion_radio_touch` / `tlora_pager_sx1262_companion_radio_touch` (beta) — [keyboard shortcuts](TLORA_PAGER_SHORTCUTS.md)
- Heltec V4-R8 + Expansion Kit V2 — env `heltec_v4_r8_tft_companion_radio_usb_tcp_touch` (beta)
- LilyGo T-Display P4 — built from `tdisplay_p4/` (ESP-IDF); AMOLED by default, `WADA_P4_LCD=1` for the TFT-LCD SKU (beta)
- Attaky Mesh Series — env `attaky_mesh_series_companion_radio_touch` (beta)

## Architecture

This repo holds only the **app**: the `companion_radio` glue, the `ui-touch`
LVGL UI, each board's glue/variants, and `platformio.ini`. The **MeshCore
core is not vendored here** — it's pulled as a library via `lib_deps` from the
[`ALLFATHER-BV/meshcomod`](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/meshcomod) monorepo
(the same repo as the non-touch firmware), pinned by a lean source-only `core-*`
git tag. The touch-app files this repo owns (TouchPrefsStore, WifiRuntimeStore,
the transports, …) are dropped from the lib via `-DMC_VENDORED_TOUCH_APP` so they
aren't compiled twice. The build is byte-identical to the original in-tree
meshcomod firmware.

Lua apps use the on-device SDK described in [LUA_APPS.md](LUA_APPS.md). For
WAV/MP3 playback, including a ready-to-sideload transport test app and exact SD
and internal-storage paths, see [AUDIO_PLAYBACK_TESTING.md](AUDIO_PLAYBACK_TESTING.md).

## Offline map tiles

Builds with a microSD card expose a **Transfer** app for authenticated browser
uploads over the local Wi-Fi network. WadaMesh accepts unpacked 256x256 PNG XYZ
tiles in a `z/x/y.png` directory tree.

To create a compatible pack with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/):

1. Add a map source whose licence and service terms explicitly permit offline
  or bulk use. A self-hosted source is also suitable. Do **not** bulk-download
  from `tile.openstreetmap.org`: the official
  [OSM tile policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)
  prohibits offline downloads from that community service.
2. Frame only the area needed in the QGIS map canvas. Tile counts quadruple at
  every added zoom level, so a small region and a practical range such as
  zoom 8 through 16 are preferable to exporting an entire country at zoom 19.
3. Open **Processing Toolbox → Raster tools → Generate XYZ tiles (Directory)**.
4. Use the map-canvas extent, choose minimum and maximum zooms within 3–19,
  select **PNG**, set tile width and height to **256**, leave **Use inverted
  tile Y axis (TMS conventions)** disabled, and select an output directory.
5. Confirm the output contains paths such as `12/2048/1362.png`. If obtaining
  an existing pack instead, extract it first and confirm it has the same XYZ
  directory layout and that its provider permits offline use and redistribution.

To upload the pack:

1. Connect the device and the browser to the same Wi-Fi network.
2. Open **Transfer** from the device's app drawer, visit the displayed URL, and
  enter the six-digit session code.
3. Choose **Offline OSM map (/tiles)**, select the generated output folder, and
  start the upload. The browser ignores unrelated files and uploads valid tiles
  sequentially while preserving their coordinates.
4. Existing tiles are skipped by default, allowing an interrupted upload to be
  resumed. Enable **Replace existing map tiles** when intentionally refreshing
  a pack.
5. Close Transfer after completion. In **Map options**, disable **Topographic
  map** and enable **Tiles from SD card**. Disable Wi-Fi to verify that the
  uploaded area renders offline.

Individual PNG tiles must be no larger than 256 KB. Keep the map provider's
required attribution and licence information with any pack you distribute.

## Build

[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) pulls the core fork and all libraries
automatically:

```bash
pio run -e heltec_v4_tft_companion_radio_usb_tcp_touch   # Heltec V4 TFT
pio run -e LilyGo_TDeck_companion_radio_touch            # LilyGo T-Deck
# or just `pio run` to build both
```

Flash with the NVS-preserving 4-component chain (bootloader / partitions /
boot_app0 / firmware at `0x0 / 0x8000 / 0xe000 / 0x10000`) so saved Wi-Fi
credentials survive — not a merged image, which 0xFF-pads and wipes NVS.

## License

**GPL-3.0-or-later** — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). wadamesh is copyleft: anyone who
distributes a build or a fork must also make their source available under the GPL.
This keeps the UI open and concentrates community effort instead of fragmenting it
into closed forks.

wadamesh incorporates and depends on
[MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore) (MIT, © Scott Powell /
rippleradios.com) and other third-party components — see [NOTICE](NOTICE) for the
full list and their licenses. MeshCore-derived files keep their MIT notices; the
combined work is distributed under the GPL (MIT is GPL-compatible). The MeshCore
fork that wadamesh builds against stays **MIT** on purpose, so its Wi-Fi/BLE hooks
remain upstreamable to MeshCore.
